# AutoCv

AutoCv is a project that allows you to automatically generate a PDF resume from a json file hosted in pocketbase.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, the json can't really be modified, and the CV must have the same structure as the template json.

You simply need to download the docker image and run it.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/matthieuev/auto-cv/auto-cv:latest
```

Then, create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
services:
  auto-cv:
    image: ghcr.io/matthieuev/auto-cv/auto-cv:latest
    platform: "linux/amd64"
    environment:
      POCKETBASE_CLIENT_URL: <YOUR_POCKETBASE_CLIENT_URL>
      POCKETBASE_EMAIL: <YOUR_POCKETBASE_EMAIL>
      POCKETBASE_PASSWORD: <YOUR_POCKETBASE_PASSWORD>

      POCKETBASE_EN_PDF_ID: <YOUR_POCKETBASE_EN_PDF_ID>
      POCKETBASE_FR_PDF_ID: <YOUR_POCKETBASE_FR_PDF_ID>
```

And run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```
